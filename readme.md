### This codebase was originally named 'Hy0rGUI' written by [Nyx](https://github.com/nnyyxxxx). as part of the HyprUtils Suite, which has since been deleted. I recently discovered that with a few tiny tweaks, it's still fully compatible with v5.00. 
HyprGUI was a huge help when I first started out in Hyprland, and I hope HyprSettings can inspire and assist newcomers to the world of TWMs ü´∂

# Usage
## Currently working on Hyprland 5.00 (17/07/2025)
HyprSettings works by editing the Hyprland.conf file in your ~/.config/hypr directory. 



# Installation
## ‚ö†Ô∏è: I run an Arch Linux system, and have not tested this on other Distributions. Arch & Arch Based Distros (CachyOS, EndeavourOS, etc) shouldn't have an issue.
### If you can help to test it on another Distro, please reach out and I'll credit you!)

Install the preferred package with:
```bash
git clone //github.com/GlassPuddle/hyprsettings
cd hyprsettings/
cargo build
```

## Building from source
1. Install Rust (preferably `rustup`) through your distro's package or [the official script](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install `git`, `pango` and `gtk4`
3. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/GlassPuddle/hyprsettings
cd hyprsettings/
4. Compile the app with `cargo build --release` or run it directly with `cargo run --release`
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://GitHub.con/GlassPuddle/HyprSettings 
cd hyprsettings/
cargo build --release
```
